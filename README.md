# (Autonomous Systems Navigation and Control Project)[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10427933]

## Overview

This repository contains multiple artifacts related to developing and simulating autonomous systems for naval and critical infrastructure use. The project encompasses the following key modules:

1. **AI Info Module:** 
   - A decision-making and data analysis module designed for autonomous systems.
   - This module integrates with various sensors and systems to enhance situational awareness and optimize navigation.
  
2. **Battleship Simulator:**
   - A comprehensive simulator for naval operations.
   - Allows the testing of different autonomous navigation algorithms in complex maritime environments.
   - Includes collision avoidance, risk-based decision-making, and multi-objective path optimization.

3. **SCADA/Weapon Modules:**
   - Simulates the control and management of critical SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems.
   - Focuses on defense systems, including weapon modules and network-based control operations for remote management.
   - Contains secure communication and failover mechanisms to ensure continuous operation in adverse conditions.
